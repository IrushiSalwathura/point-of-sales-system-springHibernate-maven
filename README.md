# POINT OF SALES SYSTEM (LAYERED ARCHITECTURE WITH SPRING AND HIBERNATE)

This POS System is revamped according the Layered Architecture in order to loose couple and  higher the cohesion between the controller and the model of the system. Apart from that, the project has used Spring and Hibernate frameworks. Spring framework consists with the Spring Core which will eventually provide Inversion of control (IoC) to the project. IoC is also known as Dependency Injection (DI) which manages the components that make up an application. Hibernate is an Object Relational Mapping(ORM) tool therefore it is concerned with data persistence as it applies to relational databases.
